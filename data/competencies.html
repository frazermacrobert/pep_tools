    <summary>How the framework works</summary>
    <p>The core competencies detail the skills and behaviours needed to perform your job successfully. Professional competencies are the ‘even better if’s’ — the extra knowledge, skills, and abilities that elevate your impact.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Benchmark yourself against each competency and identify growth actions.</li>
      <li>Use the competencies to create your development plan for discussion at your next PEP.</li>
      <li>If you’ve mastered your current role’s competencies, review the next role in your pathway.</li>
    </ul>
