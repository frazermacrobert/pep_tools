    <summary>How the framework works</summary>
    <p>The core competencies detail the required skills and behaviours needed to perform your job successfully. Professional competencies are the ‘even better if’s’ — the differential superior knowledge, skills, and abilities that elevate your impact.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Benchmark yourself against each competency and identify what you need to meet the expected level.</li>
      <li>Use the competencies to shape your development plan and discuss it at your next PEP.</li>
      <li>If you’ve mastered these, review the next role in your pathway or explore potential next steps.</li>
    </ul>

    <summary>Your role: Consultant</summary>
    <p>Build trusted, strategic partnerships with clients and drive long-term Measurable Business Value. Own the client relationship, understand broader business and employee experience challenges, and ensure every engagement delivers outcomes aligned to their priorities.</p>
    <p>You act as the voice of the client internally, championing strategic alignment, commercial clarity, and project relevance. You sit at the heart of the high-performing triangle (with DoCs and PMs), where partnership, strategy, and execution combine to create transformative client experiences.</p>
